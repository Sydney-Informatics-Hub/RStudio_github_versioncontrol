### **Questions** {.unlisted}

-   Do you have a github account?
:::

If the answer to the above question is `No`, you will need to register for a free account with GitHub at <https://github.com>. ![](../fig/githubdotcom.png) <br> Start with your email address and follow the instructions.

<br> Here are a few tips which you can follow with reference to choosing a good username:

-   Your actual name makes your username easier for people to guess or remember;
-   A shorter name is better than a longer one;
-   Keep it as unique as possible. GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames in some settings;
-   Do not use your current university, employer, place of residence or other information which is time-based and are likely to change in the future;
-   Use lowercase characters:
-   A good strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen `-`.

## Free private repos

GitHub offers free unlimited private repositories for all users. These free private repositories support up to three external collaborators, making them a perfect place for your personal projects, for job applications, and testing things out before making your project open source.
