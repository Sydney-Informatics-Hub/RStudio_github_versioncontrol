### **Questions** {.unlisted}
* Do you have a github account?
</div>

If the answer to the above question is `No`, you will need to register for a free account with GitHub at [https://github.com](https://github.com).

<br> Start with your email address and follow the instructions.

<br> Here are a few tips which you can follow with reference to choosing a good username.

* You can use your actual name which makes your username easier for people to guess or remember. Alos a shorter name is better than a longer one.
* In addition you might want to keep your github-name to be as unique as possible. GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames in some settings.
* It is advised that you do not highlight your current university, employer, place of residence or other information which is time-based in your user-name as this is likely to change in the future.
* It is recommended to use all lowercase characters in your user-name. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase could work better. A good strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen `-`.

## Free private repos
GitHub offers free unlimited private repositories for all users. These free private repositories support up to three external collaborators, making them a perfect place for your personal projects, for job applications, and testing things out before making your project open source.
